Homework 02 â€” Working with CSS and Bootstrap

## Highlights From Project
* Navbar designates the "active" link for each page and includes the `sr-only` class for link. This is to help people understand what page they are on, from both a UX and accessibility standpoint. 

* Made the navigation fixed, so it stays in position when scrolling

* On mobile gave the image a shadow for stylistic purposes. 

* Added a meta description for SEO benifits and for Google to grab and display on the SERP page.
